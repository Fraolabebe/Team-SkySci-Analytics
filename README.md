According to the IPCC, 98% of global heating caused by human activity is due to greenhouse gas emissions, while the remaining 2% is attributed to contrails. During both day and night, long-lived contrails reflect around 33% of the Earth's outgoing thermal radiation back to the surface, disrupting the planet's energy balance. During the day, contrails also reflect incoming solar radiation back into space, resulting in a cooling effect of around 10%.

This project aims to develop a (Machine Learning) model to calibrate weather measurement/forecast data.

### Approach:
* Training ML (classification?) algorithm <br>
* Features: atmospheric data such as temperature, humidity, altitude/pressure from atmospheric measurements/forecasts <br>
* Target: presence/absence of contrails derived from sky images
