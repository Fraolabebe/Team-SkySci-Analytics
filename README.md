# DLNN Contrail Avoidance Model
The DLNN Contrail Avoidance Model is a machine learning project aimed at developing a model to assist in contrail avoidance. Contrails, the white trails left behind by aircraft in the sky, contribute to global heating and disrupt the Earth's energy balance. This project focuses on utilizing atmospheric data and sky images to accurately predict the presence or absence of contrails.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to calibrate weather measurement and forecast data, specifically focusing on contrail avoidance. The model will utilize atmospheric data such as temperature, humidity, and altitude/pressure obtained from atmospheric measurements and forecasts. Additionally, it will incorporate sky images to derive information about the presence of contrails.
