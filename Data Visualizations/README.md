# Project Repository: Data Exploration and Visualization

This repository contains files related to data exploration and visualization of atmospheric and contrail-related data. The main goal of this project is to provide insights and visualizations that enhance our understanding of atmospheric conditions and contrail formation.

## Files and Directories

- `Data Exploratory.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration and analysis.
- `Data ExploratoryCleanedupFile`: A cleaned-up version of the data exploration notebook.
- `RAP DATA VISUALS.zip`: Compressed file containing visuals generated from the analysis.
- `atmospheric_data_ice_humidity.csv`: Raw data file containing atmospheric ice humidity data.
- `cleaned_atmospheric.csv`: Cleaned version of the atmospheric data.
- `contrail_disection.csv`: Raw data file containing contrail-related data.
- `contrail_formation_questions.R`: R script for data visualization and exploration of contrail formation.
- `reduceHumidity.py`: Python script for reducing humidity values in the atmospheric data.
- `visualize_atmospheric_data.R`: R script for visualizing atmospheric data.

## Usage

1. Start by exploring the `Data Exploratory.ipynb` notebook to gain insights into the atmospheric and contrail data.
2. The cleaned version of the atmospheric data is available in the `cleaned_atmospheric.csv` file, ready for further analysis.
3. Utilize the provided R and Python scripts for data visualization and reduction of humidity values.
4. Extract and explore the visuals in the `RAP DATA VISUALS.zip` file for a visual representation of the analysis.

## Getting Started

To use the provided scripts and notebooks, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need Jupyter Notebook for running `.ipynb` files, R for running R scripts, and Python for running `.py` scripts.

```bash
pip install jupyterlab  # For Jupyter Notebook
Rscript contrail_formation_questions.R  # For R script
python reduceHumidity.py  # For Python script
```
